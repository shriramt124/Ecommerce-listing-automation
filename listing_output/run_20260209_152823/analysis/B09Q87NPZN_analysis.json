        "our_benefit": "Thick vinyl coating prevents painful pressure points and provides a secure, non-slip grip during intense workouts.",
        "competitor_issue": "Cheap rubber coatings are often thin and tear easily, exposing the metal core and creating a slipping hazard."
      },
      {
        "our_benefit": "Hexagon-shaped edges prevent rolling for safe storage and allow them to be laid flat on the floor during exercises.",
        "competitor_issue": "Standard round dumbbells frequently roll away on hard floors, creating a tripping hazard and disrupting workouts."
      },
      {
        "our_benefit": "Professional-grade solid cast-iron core ensures long-term durability and consistent weight distribution for reliable performance.",
        "competitor_issue": "Budget dumbbells often use inferior fillers like concrete or sand, which can shift or break apart over time."

      {
        "our_benefit": "Vibrant, color-coded design makes it easy to quickly identify the correct weight, saving time and reducing frustration.",
        "competitor_issue": "Many low-cost options have faded or peeling paint, making weight identification difficult and the product look worn out quickly."
