  "ai_description": "The product is a set of two vibrant purple dumbbells. Each dumbbell has a thick, coated metal shaft and hexagonal end caps, which are prominently stamped with the white 'KAKSS' brand logo and the weight '4 KG'. The main barrel appears to be coated in a smooth, consistent purple material, likely neoprene or a similar vinyl, giving it a slightly soft and non-slip texture. The dumbbells are shown both in a clean studio setting on a white surface and in a practical context, resting on a black rubber gym floor, emphasizing their sturdy construction and stability due to the hexagonal ends that prevent rolling.",
