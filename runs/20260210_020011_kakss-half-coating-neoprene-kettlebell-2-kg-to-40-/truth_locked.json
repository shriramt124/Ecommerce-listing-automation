  "ai_description": "This is a bright yellow kettlebell with a contrasting black handle, creating a bold and highly visible fitness product. The kettlebell has a classic spherical shape with a thick, sturdy handle designed for a secure grip. The brand name 'KAKSS' and the weight '8 KG' are clearly printed in white lettering on the front of the yellow body. The surface appears to have a durable neoprene coating on the main body while the handle remains uncoated metal, giving it a half-coated appearance. The product looks new and ready for use.",
