    "Premium Material: We started with the highest quality first run in iron available, not scrap.",
    "Void free surface: We use a proprietary casting process so each bell can reach the highest quality and have the cleanest finish possible. This also allows us to have a smooth, comfortable handle.",
    "Single Piece Casting: The Kakss Kettlebell is cast in one solid piece, creating a stronger, more reliable handle and a void free surface. The Kakss Kettlebell does not use plastic caps, plugs, or patches like lower quality products.",
    "Wide Flat Machined Base: We chose to machine the base of our kettlebell flat (not leave it as a raw casting) so it sits perfectly on the floor and does not wobble.",
    "Weight Tolerance: +/- 3%"
