  "manual": "Manufactured using REACH-compliant, non-toxic materials, these dumbbells feature an odor-free, color-stable coating that resists fading and wear over time. The carbon-free composition ensures a cleaner, safer finish, while the surface texture remains consistent and comfortable even under extreme hot or cold temperature conditions. Designed with a precision hex shape, the dumbbells offer enhanced ground stability and prevent rolling during floor-based exercises, making them safe, durable, and reliable for everyday training.",
